    <h2 align="center"> React Exercises at 4Geeks Academy (beta) </h2>
</p>

You can find lots of interactive tutorials online, but none about React.js. That's why we decided to create a very complete selection of autograded react.js exercises developers interested in learning React.js: For seniors or juniors!

### Enjoy!

Make sure you have the [breathecode-cli](https://github.com/breatheco-de/breathecode-cli) installed and `node.js` version 8+
```
This is the command to install the breathecode-cli
$ npm i breathecode-cli -g
```

To download the react exercises in the current directory run:
```
$ bc start:react-exercises -r
```

Once you finish downloading, you will find a "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

## Start making the exercises

To start the coding editor and read the instructions run the following command from the root of the project:

```sh
$ npm i jest -g
$ bc run:exercises
```

</p>

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **index.js:** represents the entry file for the entire app.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.
