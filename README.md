# React Exercises at 4Geeks Academy (beta)

Make sure you have the [breathecode-cli](https://github.com/breatheco-de/breathecode-cli) installed and node.js version 8

To download the react exercises run:
```
$ bc start:react-exercises -r
```

Once you finish downloading, you will find a "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **index.js:** represents the entry file for the entire app.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

### Reading the instructions
We have created a small application to read the instructions in a better format, to run it type the following on your command line:
```sh
$ bc run:instructions
```
### Completing the exercises
One you finish reading the instructions, start a development server for the particular exercise you want to preview:
```sh
$ bc run:exercise -n=<exercise number>
```
Note: you have to replace ```<exercise number>``` with the real exercise number you want to run.

Once the development server is running you can start coding your solution on any of the files inside the exercise folder number.
