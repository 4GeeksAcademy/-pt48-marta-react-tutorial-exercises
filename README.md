    <h2 align="center"> React Exercises at 4Geeks Academy (beta) </h2>
</p>

Make sure you have the [breathecode-cli](https://github.com/breatheco-de/breathecode-cli) installed and `node.js` version 8

To download the react exercises run:
```
$ bc start:react-exercises -r
```

Once you finish downloading, you will find a "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **index.js:** represents the entry file for the entire app.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

## Start making the exercises

To start the coding editor and read the instructions run the following command:

```sh
$ bc run:exercises
```
