# React Exercises at 4Geeks Academy (beta)

Make sure you have the [breathecode-cli](https://github.com/breatheco-de/breathecode-cli) installed and node.js version 8

To download the react exercises run:
```
$ bc start:react-exercises -r
```

Once you finish downloading, you will find a "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:
    1. __index.js__: represents the entry file for the entire app.
    2. __README.md__: contains exercise instructions.
    3. __test.js__: you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

Each folder also have a README.md file that you can open to read the instructions or you can run the following command from the root directory to read the instructions in a cleaner format:
```sh
$ bc run:instructions
```

One you finish reading the instructions for an exercise you can run the following command to start a development server and live-test your app as you code:
```sh
$ bc run:exercise -n=<exercise number>
```
Note: you have to replace ```<exercise number>``` with the real exercise number you want to run.
