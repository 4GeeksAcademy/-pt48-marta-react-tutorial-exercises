# 03: Creating a Link component

In the past exercise we created a `<Dropdrown />` component, let's try to create another very simple one.

In this exercise you will find a `<Link>` component that you can use just like a regular anchor, for example:

This is an example of an `<a>` tag being used in an HTML document
```jsx
<a href="http://www.google.com">Go to google.com</a>
```
This is how you can do the same thing with a `<Link>` tag component.
```jsx
<Link href="http://www.google.com">Go to google.com</Link>
```
